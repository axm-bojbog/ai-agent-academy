# AXM 365 AI Agent Academy

![Copilot Studio Agent Academy Recruit](./docs/images/mcs-agent-academy-recruit-banner.png)
**Welcome, Intern.**  
Your missionâ€”should you choose to accept itâ€”is to master the art of building agents using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**.

This hands-on training is your entry point into the **world of agents**: from grounded prompts to Adaptive Cards and agent flows, you'll learn how to build and scale intelligent agents using real-world tools and use cases.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission Objective

By completing the Agent Academy, you'll be able to:

- Understand what agents are in the context of Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Explore how Large Language Models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and orchestration come together in an agent
- Build both **declarative** and **custom agents**
- Enhance agents with **Topics**, **Adaptive Cards**, and **Agent Flows**

# AXM 365 AI Agent Academy

![Copilot Studio Agent Academy Recruit](./images/mcs-agent-academy-recruit-banner.png)
**Welcome, Intern.**  
Your missionâ€”should you choose to accept itâ€”is to master the art of building agents using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**.

This hands-on training is your entry point into the **world of agents**: from grounded prompts to Adaptive Cards and agent flows, you'll learn how to build and scale intelligent agents using real-world tools and use cases.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Put your initials as a **prefix** to any object you are creating in any environment. Any Copilot Studio or SharePoint compontnets should start with your initials, followed by underscore. For example, every object John Johnson creates will have prefix JJ_xxx, where xxx is custom name of the object.

> [!CAUTION]
> **DO NOT PUBLISH** Copilot Agents that you are creating. Once published, agents start to generate **on-the-go cost for consumption**. Test the agents only by using the testing pane on the right side of the screen.
